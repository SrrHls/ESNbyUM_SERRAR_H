Complications in Skull Base Surgery and Subsequent Repair,"Over the past several decades, endoscopic sinus surgery has revolutionized the approach to skull base surgery. Open skull base approaches remain a viable option for advanced skull base tumors. Complications have gone down with increased reliability of vascularized tissue transfer. In this article, the authors explore the various complications that can present following skull base surgery and review the approaches for repair when such issues are encountered.","Weitao Wang, 1, Tom Shokri, 1, Spiros Manolidis, 2, Yadranko Ducic, 1"
Perioperative Considerations in Endoscopic Skull Base Surgery,"Purpose of the review:Present an overview of perioperative considerations specific to endoscopic skull base surgery necessary to maximize successful outcomes.Recent findings:The majority of perioperative considerations for endoscopic skull base surgery lack strong supporting evidence and frequently have varied use or implementation amongst institutions. A notable exception comes from a recent randomized controlled trial demonstrating the benefit of lumbar drainage in high-risk cerebrospinal fluid leaks.Summary:Skull base surgeons must consider a multitude of perioperative factors. While many components of perioperative management are extrapolated from related fields such as endoscopic sinus surgery or open cranial base surgery, additional high-quality studies are needed to delineate best practices specific to endoscopic skull base surgery.","Adnan S Hussaini, 1, Christine M Clark, 1, Timothy R DeKlotz, 1"
How close are we to anterior robotic skull base surgery?,"Purpose of review:The application of robotic surgery to anterior skull base disease has yet to be defined despite the potential for improved tumour resection with less morbidity in this region. Complex anatomy and restricted access have limited the development of robotic anterior skull base surgery.Recent findings:A limited number of transoral robotic surgical anterior skull base procedures have been undertaken; however, there are significant limitations to the utilization of this technology in the anterior skull base. In this article, the advantages, disadvantages and limitations of robotic anterior skull base surgery are discussed. Currently, the major limitation is the size of the robotic endoscope and of the available instrumentation. Technological advancements that provide promise for the future development of robotic anterior skull base surgery are in development, such as single-port robots, flexible instrument systems and miniaturization and growth of minimally invasive platforms.Summary:Although transnasal access to the skull base is not possible with the currently available robotic systems, promising technology does exist and is in development. Robotic anterior skull base surgery promises to provide greater access to skull base disease, improve oncologic results, reduce morbidity and to reduce the ergonomic burden on the surgeon.","Raewyn G Campbell, 1, 2, 3, Richard J Harvey, 1, 3"

[History of Skull Base Surgery],"Skull base surgery is a surgical field that involves the cooperation of multiple surgical and medical specialties, including neurosurgery, head-neck surgery, plastic-reconstructive surgery, radiation oncology, as well as multiple medical supporting teams. This field has been developed with the collaborative efforts of these medical specialties, and its history can be divided into five phases: Beginning of surgery(Prior to 1940); Early skull base surgery driven by the ENT-HN surgery group(1940-70); Conventional skull base surgery development based on anatomical, physiological knowledge and microsurgical equipment and technique(1970-90); Reflection and consolidation of the surgical dimension(1995-2005); and Evolution of endoscopic and new skull base surgical techniques(2005-). Several topics and advancements have improved this surgical field, such as access to the cavernous sinus, petrosal-temporal bone, and foramen magnum; concepts of minimally invasive surgical techniques; advanced endoscopic instruments; knowledge of biological assessments; and development of surgical robotics. To achieve a safe and effective surgery for cases of difficult cranial base lesions, clinicians must understand the origin of the surgical field, the detailed anatomy and physiology of the skull base, and the basic microsurgical techniques.","Akio Morita, 1"

Much of this literature is focused on minimally invasive, endoscopic techniques, which have expanded greatly in the last decade.Summary:This article summarizes the most current opinion in the field of anterior skull-base surgery. Recent literature regarding new anatomic insights, surgical techniques (resection and reconstruction), and outcomes data are outlined.","Aaron M Fletcher, 1, Lawrence Marentette"
Endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery,"Skull base surgery has been transformed by the development of endoscopic techniques. Endoscopic procedures were first used for pituitary surgery and were then gradually extended to other regions. A wide range of diseases are now accessible to endoscopic skull base surgery. The major advantage of the endoscopic endonasal approach is that it provides direct anatomical access to a large number of intracranial and paranasal sinus lesions, avoiding the sequelae of a skin incision, facial bone flap or craniotomy, and brain retraction, which is inevitable with conventional neurosurgical incisions, resulting in decreased morbidity and mortality and, indirectly, decreased length of hospital stay and management costs. Moreover, the increasing number of publications in this field illustrates the growing interest in these techniques. This paper provides a review of endoscopic skull base surgery. The indications and general principles of endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery are described. Progress in exposure and especially reconstruction techniques is described. This progress now allows more extensive resections, while maintaining acceptable morbidity. The limits of this surgery are also discussed; in particular, although this surgery is often described as ""minimally invasive"", it is not completely devoid of morbidity.","B Verillaud, 1, D Bresson, E Sauvaget, E Mandonnet, B Georges, R Kania, P Herman"
Safety of restarting continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy following endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery,"Objectives:Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are at increased risk of perioperative and postoperative morbidity. The use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the perioperative period may be of potential benefit. However, among patients who have undergone endonasal skull base surgery, many surgeons avoid prompt re-initiation of CPAP therapy due to the theoretical increased risk of epistaxis, excessive dryness, pneumocephalus, repair migration, intracranial introduction of bacteria, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. The objective of this article is to review the most up-to-date literature regarding when it is safe to resume CPAP usage in the patient undergoing endonasal skull base surgery.Data sources and methods:This review combines the most recent literature as queried through PubMed regarding the safety of CPAP resumption following endonasal skull base surgery.Results:Recent surveys of skull base surgeons demonstrate little consensus regarding the post-operative management of OSA. Recent cadaveric studies suggest that approximately 85% of delivered CPAP pressures are transmitted to the sphenoid sinus. Further, at frequently prescribed CPAP pressure settings, common sellar reconstruction techniques maintain their integrity while preventing very little transmission of pressure into the sella. In small retrospective case series, patients with OSA who received CPAP immediately following transsphenoidal pituitary surgery had similar rates of surgical complications as OSA patients who did not receive CPAP in the immediate post-operative period. Concerns of re-initiating CPAP too early, such as the development of pneumocephalus, rarely develop.Conclusions:There remains a paucity of objective data regarding when it is safe to resume CPAP following endonasal skull base surgery. Recent cadaveric studies and small retrospective case series suggest that it may be safe to resume CPAP earlier than is often practiced following endonasal skull base surgery.","Mark B Chaskes, 1, Mindy R Rabinowitz, 1"
The Current State of Visualization Techniques in Endoscopic Skull Base Surgery,"Skull base surgery has undergone significant progress following key technological developments. From early candle-lit devices to the modern endoscope, refinements in visualization techniques have made endoscopic skull base surgery (ESBS) a standard practice for treating a variety of conditions. The endoscope has also been integrated with other technologies to enhance visualization, including fluorescence agents, intraoperative neuronavigation with augmented reality, and the exoscope. Endoscopic approaches have allowed neurosurgeons to reevaluate skull base neuroanatomy from new perspectives. These advances now serve as the foundation for future developments in ESBS. In this narrative review, we discuss the history and development of ESBS, current visualization techniques, and future innovations.","Jakub Jarmula, 1, Erion Junior de Andrade, 2, Varun R Kshettry, 1, 2, Pablo F Recinos, 1, 2, 3"

[Prevention of and Countermeasures for Surgical Site Infection in the Field of Skull Base Surgery],"In neurosurgery, perioperative surgical site infection(SSI)is associated with complicated postoperative management, prolonged hospital stay, and patient stress. In this article, we review SSI in the field of skull base surgery, including endoscopic endonasal surgery, and discuss ways to prevent SSI. In a craniotomy, in which the frontal sinus is revealed, prevention of cerebrospinal fluid(CSF)leakage by reliable repair of the dura and frontal sinus reduces SSI. In addition, prevention of postoperative CSF leakage by reliable skull base reconstruction in endoscopic endonasal surgery contributes to the prevention of SSI. Prophylactic antibiotics are often reported to be useful, and cephalosporin or sulbactam/ampicillin intravenous injections are generally used. There are insufficient data to recommend lumbar drainage for the management of SSI and postoperative CSF leak. Skull base surgery is often a clean-contaminated surgery, and serious complications can be prevented by proper understanding and performance of the appropriate method as required. However, no studies with a high level of evidence on SSI in the field of skull base surgery exist. New large randomized controlled trials are expected to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics in skull base surgery.","Shinichiro Koizumi, 1, Kazuhiko Kurozumi"
Comprehensive Postoperative Management After Endoscopic Skull Base Surgery,"To maximize outcomes from endoscopic skull base surgery, careful early postoperative management is critically important. Standardized postoperative regimens are lacking. The type of reconstruction and presence and type of cerebrospinal fluid leak dictate management. If a leak is encountered intraoperatively, patients should avoid maneuvers that increase intracranial pressures for at least 1 month. Early postoperative care focuses on minimizing and managing nasal crusting. This article reviews the evidence in the literature on postoperative management, complications, and quality of life after surgery, and outlines our experience in the management of patients after endoscopic skull base surgery.","Duc A Tien, 1, Janalee K Stokken, 2, Pablo F Recinos, 3, Troy D Woodard, 3, Raj Sindwani, 4"
The contribution of oncological lateral skull base surgery to the management of advanced head-neck tumors,"Background:Lateral skull base is a complex area between the brain and the neck that is characterized by a large anatomic variability in narrow spaces and wide heterogeneity of tissues. The complexity of the anatomy makes it more difficult to accurately identify tumor spread and surgical planning is here particularly demanding.Aims:Oncological skull base surgery is conceived for malignant lesions originating in, secondarily infiltrating, or in close proximity to the lateral skull base. It is also conceived for selected aggressive or benign lesions of the parapharyngeal space and infratemporal fossa abutting the skull base, or crossing it from above downwards to the neck. This paper is focused on the role that oncological skull base surgery plays to resect tumors in this area.Methods and results:Three main types of head and neck lesions can be identified as paradigms of the philosophy of oncological lateral skull base surgery, and are herein presented: (i) primary malignant tumors of the ear; (ii) advanced malignant parotid tumors; (iii) primary malignant or locally aggressive tumors of the infratemporal fossa-parapharyngeal space. The en-bloc lateral and subtotal temporal bone resections, the en-bloc temporo-parotid resection and the combined subtemporal-transcervical-transparotid resection are described, respectively.Conclusions and significance:Different histologies are found in the lateral skull base and adjacent areas, and each histology has its own pattern of growth and undetected spreading in a difficult-to-reach surgical area. The leading principle is to create a wide access through soft tissues and bone removal far enough from the tumor to obtain a complete resection, en-bloc radical resection in malignancies. The entity of dissection is obviously modulated on the tumor triad (histology, pattern of growth, extent) and is achieved through the en-bloc and combined approaches that are here described.","Elisabetta Zanoletti, 1, Gino Marioni, 1, Piero Nicolai, 1, Antonio Mazzoni, 1, 2"
Outcomes in Pediatric Endoscopic Skull Base Surgery: A Systematic Review,"ObjectivesThe frequency of endoscopic skull base surgery in pediatric patients is increasing. This study aims to systematically review the literature for endoscopic skull base surgery outcomes in children/adolescents aged 0 to 18 years.DesignA systematic review of the literature was performed in PubMed and SCOPUS databases querying studies from 2000 to 2020 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Final inclusion criteria included: case series with more than 10 patients with pediatric patients aged ≤18 years, endoscopic or endoscopic-assisted skull base surgery, and outcomes reported.SettingThis study was conducted at a tertiary care medical center.ParticipantsChildren/adolescents aged 0 to 18 years who underwent endoscopic skull base surgery were participated in this study.Main Outcome MeasuresPatient demographics, pathology, reconstructive technique, intraoperative findings, intraoperative, and postoperative surgical complications were measured through this study.ResultsSystematic literature search yielded 287 publications. Of these, 12 studies discussing a total of 399 patients aged 0 to 18 years met inclusion criteria for final analysis. Seven of the 12 studies discussed a single pathology. The most common pathology was a skull base defect causing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. The majority of skull base repairs were made with free tissue grafts. The most common postoperative complication was CSF leak (n= 40). Twelve cases of meningitis occurred postoperatively with two of these episodes resulting in death.ConclusionEndoscopic skull base surgery has been performed recently in the pediatric population in a variety of disease states. Inconsistent individual-level data and reporting standards are present in existing studies posing challenges for comparative analysis. Standardized reporting will aid future reviews and meta-analysis for rare skull base pathology.","Erin M Lopez, 1, Zainab Farzal, 1, Kelly M Dean, 1, Craig Miller, 1, Justin C Morse, 1, Charles S Ebert Jr, 1, Adam J Kimple, 1, Brian D Thorp, 1, Adam M Zanation, 1"
Application of Ultrasonic Aspirators in Rhinology and Skull Base Surgery,"Ultrasonic aspirators (UAs) are increasingly being used in rhinology and skull base surgery. The use of ultrasonic vibration for the removal of bony tissue transfers minimal heat to surrounding tissues and is relatively atraumatic to nearby soft tissue structures. This article details the development and application of this technology in septoturbinoplasty, endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR), and skull base surgery. The benefits and limitations of UAs compared with conventionally powered instruments are discussed.","Dominic Vernon, 1, Brian C Lobo, 2, Jonathan Y Ting, 3"
Anesthetic Techniques in Endoscopic Sinus and Skull Base Surgery,"Endoscopic sinus approach has become one of the most common surgical techniques for endoscopic sinus and skull base surgery. Anesthetic management has an important impact on the overall patient management, from the preoperative assessment and management to the quality of the surgical field and the postoperative recovery. Hemostasis is critical for adequate anatomical endoscopic visualization. Mild controlled hypotension seems to improve the visibility of the surgical field. Reduction of intraoperative bleeding should be considered during the treatment planning. Preoperative preparations include the optimization of comorbidities and cessation of drugs that may inhibit coagulation.","Martha Cordoba Amorocho, 1, Iuliu Fat, 2"
Transnasal endoscopic skull base surgery: what are the limits?,"Purpose of review:Endoscopic skull base surgery has significantly revolutionized the management of skull base disease. Our review focuses on the recent literature relating to endoscopic skull base surgery emphasizing its limitations.Recent findings:Current literature continues to expand the indications for endoscopic approaches to the skull base. Experience in endoscopic techniques continues to grow across the world. This is due in part to advances in instrumentation and technology, improvements in technique and, more importantly, an increase in the number of surgeons with training in endoscopic techniques. Long-term outcome data remain sparse.Summary:The limitations in endoscopic skull base surgery have not been reached. Increasing experience and improvement in technology will likely expand current indications. Future studies should focus on outcome analysis.","C Arturo Solares, 1, Yew Kwang Ong, Carl H Snyderman"
[Overview and prospects of endoscopic skull base surgery],"Endoscopic skull base surgery presents significant technical challenges and high surgical risks, requiring collaboration among multiple disciplines such as otolaryngology, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, and oral maxillofacial surgery. In recent years, there has been rapid development in endoscopic skull base surgery, characterized by flourishing anatomical research and an expanding range of surgical indications. The future brings both opportunities and challenges, and endoscopic skull base surgery must grasp new directions in medical development, actively providing patients with safer and more effective treatment options.","Dehui Wang, 1, Huankang Zhang, 1"
Skull base surgery for benign skull base tumors,"The use of skull base techniques in the treatment of benign skull base tumors has allowed access to areas of the brain once considered inaccessible. The most common benign skull base tumors encountered in neurosurgical practice are benign meningiomas, schwannomas, and glomus jugulare tumors. Gross total resection of these lesions gives patients the best possible chance of a cure. In this paper, we review the rationale for the use of skull base surgery techniques for benign skull base tumors.","Ketan R Bulsara, 1, Ossama Al-Mefty"
Tension pneumocephalus after skull base surgery. A case report and review of literature,"Pneumocephalus describes the presence of air within the cranial cavity and is often self-limiting. Tension pneumocephalus is a neurosurgical emergency manifested by headaches, seizures, reduced consciousness and even death resulting from raised intracranial pressure. Differentiating both entities clinically is often challenging but crucial. We present a case involving a sixty-year-old male who was transferred to our unit after he collapsed while undergoing rehabilitation. The patient had undergone a combined bifrontal craniotomy and transnasal endoscopic resection of recurrent sinonasal adenocarcinoma with anterior skull base involvement eight days prior. Imaging demonstrated the classic Mt. Fuji sign and a diagnosis of tension pneumocephalus was formed. The patient proceeded for definitive management which included a multi-layered repair of the anterior skull base. The three mechanisms that propose the development of tension pneumocephalus include the ball-valve mechanism, the inverted soda-bottle effect and rarely, infection from gas forming organisms. A review of current literature on PubMed/MEDLINE revealed tension pneumocephalus after skull base surgery to be a rare entity with only eleven cases reported. Most patients achieved complete recovery of symptoms post-treatment. Clinicians should recognise tension pneumocephalus as a potential complication after skull base surgery. Accurate diagnosis requires appreciation of imaging features and a high index of suspicion. Prompt management is imperative to prevent possible devastating outcomes.","R D Biju, 1, J Wu, 2, Z Hussain, 2"
The evolving role of the oculoplastic surgeon in skull base surgery,"Purpose of review:Classical orbital approaches in skull base surgery have involved large incisions with extensive bone removal resulting in prolonged recovery with associated morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this review is to explore recent advances in skull base surgery that are applicable to the orbital surgeon.Recent findings:Transnasal endoscopic surgery provides access to the medial 180 degrees of the orbit. Access to the lateral 180 degrees may be obtained using transmaxillary and transcranial techniques. Transorbital approaches and multiport techniques further expand the reach of the skull base surgeon. These minimally invasive techniques are supplanting the classical pterional, frontotemporal, frontotemporal orbitozygomatic, frontal, and subfrontal approaches.Summary:The role of the orbital surgeon in skull base surgery is changing. Transnasal and transcranial approaches to orbital disorders using minimally invasive techniques are becoming more common. In addition, transorbital access to the skull base, paranasal sinuses, and anterior and middle cranial fossa is offering new opportunities for the orbital surgeon.","Richard C Allen, 1"

Skull Base Surgery with Minimal Resources,"Background:Skull base surgery needs advanced equipment and is performed at few public sector hospitals in India. For financial and infrastructure reasons, the facilities available are insufficient for the large number of poor patients who need this surgery.Methods:Neurologically deteriorating poor patients who failed to receive skull base surgery at overloaded public sector hospitals underwent surgery with basic neurosurgical instruments, using the available resources and indigenously designed instruments adhering to the basic principles of skull base surgery. Various lesions operated on in the study were analyzed based on their location and surgical approach.Results:Ninety-one skull base surgeries in 84 patients were performed during 2013-2015. There were 46 males and 38 females, with an average age of 35 years. Surgical treatment included surgery of the craniovertebral junction (n = 43) and lesions of the anterior skull base (n = 7), middle skull base (n = 10), and posterior skull base (n = 31). Lesions were operated on through anterior (n = 10), lateral (n = 14), and posterior and posterolateral (n = 67) skull base approaches.Conclusions:The facilities available in low-income countries such as India are insufficient to take care of poor patients who need skull base surgery. Indigenous innovations, use of the available resources, and interdisciplinary coordination help overcome the challenges of resource scarcity to a reasonable extent in many ill-equipped public sector hospitals for the safe and efficient management of many patients who need skull base surgery.","Deepak K Jha, 1, Mukul Jain, 2, Sujata Chaturvedi, 3, Renu Goyal, 4, Arvind Arya, 2, Suman Kushwaha, 5, Anil Thakur, 6"
"Preservation of nasal turbinates in endoscopic, anterior skull base surgery-yes, we can!","Objective:To evaluate the frequency, type and indications of nasal turbinate (NT) resection during endoscopic, anterior skull base surgery and to analyze factors that may have an impact on the need of NT removal.Methods:In this retrospective cohort study, 306 subjects (150 males and 156 females, mean age 55.4 ± 15.3 years) who underwent multidisciplinary, transnasal, endoscopic tumor surgery of the anterior skull base using 4-handed techniques between 2011 and 2019 at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Medical University of Graz, were included.Results:In the majority of interventions (n = 281/306; 91.8%), all NT were preserved. Significant factors influencing the need of NT resections turned out to be type of endoscopic approach (p < 0.001; V = 0.304), sagittal (p = 0.003; d = 0.481) and transversal (p = 0.017; d = 0.533) tumor diameter, tumor type (p < 0.001; V = 0.355) and tumor location (p < 0.001; V = 0.324).Conclusions:NT can be preserved in the majority of patients undergoing tumor resection in anterior, transnasal, skullbase surgery and routine resection of NT should be avoided. Variables that have an impact on the need of NT resections are types of endoscopic approaches, sagittal and transversal tumor extension and tumor type. These factors should be considered in planning of surgery and preoperative information of patients.","Axel Wolf, #, 1, Alexandros Andrianakis, #, 1, Peter Valentin Tomazic, 2, Michael Mokry, 3, Georg Clarici, 3, Etienne Holl, 3, Thomas Weiland, 1, Peter Kiss, 1, Sarah Vasicek, 1, Anna Brunner, 3, Christian Lehner, 3, Johannes Schwarz, 1, Verena Gellner, 3"
